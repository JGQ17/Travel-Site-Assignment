			<h2>Welcome to Let's Travel the World!</h2>

			<p class="par1">By traveling - both within the USA and abroad - we expand our horizons and gain a greater apprecciation of the world we live in.</p>
			<p class="par2">Experiencing new cultures, including new food, languages, and customs, challenges us and makes us better understand our culture.</p>
			<p class="par3">We  are a full service travel agency. As seasoned travelers ourselves, we know what we're talking about and can draw upon our own experiences when putting together a great adventure for you and your family.</p>
			<p class="par4">Once you've enjoyed a couple great tips, you might just "catch the bug" like we did and start planning two or three trips ahead! Maybe you'll even put a big world map up on your wall at home and get out the color pushpins...</p>
			<p class="par5">So contact us today and let's start planning your next amazing trip!</p>
